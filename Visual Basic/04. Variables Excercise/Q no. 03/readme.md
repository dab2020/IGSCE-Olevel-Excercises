# Question
Declare a decimal variable ‘num’. Assign a value to it. Then see if the assigned value is a negative number.
## Explaination
I first assigned a value to num
```
Dim num As Decimal
        num = -1
```
I then added a line that print a message that tells the user how to interpet the output.
``` Console.WriteLine("If true this number is positive and if false the number is negative") ```
Finally I added ```  Console.WriteLine(num > 0) ``` this compares the number in comparison to zero and this means that true is a positive number and false a negative number.
