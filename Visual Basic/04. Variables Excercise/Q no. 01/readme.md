# Question
Declare an integer variable ‘mynum’. Assign a value to it. Increase the assigned value by 7 and print the new number.
# Explaination
## 1st Method
We are first declaring the variable mynum as an integer and specifying it as 3
```
Dim mynum As Integer
        mynum = 3
```
Then I just made it print a title showing that this was the second method with ``` Console.WriteLine("First Method of doing it") ```.
<br>
After That I made it add the value of mynum with 3 with the following code ``` Console.WriteLine(mynum + 7) ```
<br> and thats it

## Second Method
For this I again first declared and specified the value of mynum
```
Dim mynum As Integer
        mynum = 3
```
Then I made it print a line that simple stated that this was the second method with ``` Console.WriteLine("Second Method") ```
<br>
Then I declared and specified the value of add (the number to be added)
```
Dim add As Integer
        add = 7
```
After it was simply a matter of making it print the result of addition
```  Console.WriteLine(mynum + add) ```
