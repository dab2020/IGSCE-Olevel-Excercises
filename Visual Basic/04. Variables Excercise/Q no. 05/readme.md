# Question
Declare two string variables ‘word1’ and ‘word2’. Assign values to both variables.
Concatenate and store the values of the two variables in a third variable and print it.

## Explaination
I first declared the three variable needed word1, word2 and word3
```
 Dim word1, word2, word3 As String
 ```
 
 I then gave values to all of them
 ```
  word1 = "My Name is "
        word2 = "Dayyan Abdullah"
        word3 = word1 + word2
```
Notice that I added a extra space at the end of "my name is " This is to make sure that the formatting looks okay. The word3 variable is a combination of word1 and word2
<br>
Then I simply printed it
```
Console.WriteLine(word3)
```
