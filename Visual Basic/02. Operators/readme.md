These are operators that can be used to perofrm logical, comparative or arithimatic operations
# Types of operators
## Mathematical operators

  <li> +  : Addition</li>
  <li> /  : Division</li>
  <li> -   : Substraction</li>
  <li> *  : Multiplication</li>
  <li> MOD  : Remainder</li>
  
  ## Comparison Operator
  
  <li>< lesser than</li>
    <li>> greater than</li>
      <li>= Equal</li>
        <li><= lesser than or equal to</li>
          <li>>= greater than or equal to</li>
  <li><> not equal</li>

## Logical operator
You should know this is a computer student. These are things like AND OR NOT.
The computer takes 1 as true and 0 as False. So keep this in mind when consulting truth tables

# Explaination
  If I start giving a explaination, it will take a lot of time. The code is self explainatory, so heres a pic with the result side by side.

  ## The lack of quotation marks
  The lack of quotation marks shows that this is a expression that needs to be evaluated.
