## Variables
Variables are used to store values that can be used through out the code.
## How to declare
It is super easy to declare variables in Python. Python has no command for declaring a variable as variables are created when you assign a value to it.
e.g
```
x = 256
a = "Hello Everyone"
```
## Specify Type of data
Normally Python dosent need that data be specified however you can specify them in this method.
```
x = int(3)
```
You can replace the ``` int ``` with stuff like ``` str ``` for text and ``` float ``` for decimal
## Example
``` Q: Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle while storing its widht and height as variables ```
## Explaination
We will first specify the variables
```
widht = int(10)
height = int(15)
```

Then we can multiply them and store the result as area
``` area = widht * height ```
then we can simply print this
``` print(area) ```
