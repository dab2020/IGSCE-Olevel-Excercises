# about
These are operators that can be used to perofrm logical, comparative or arithimatic operations
# Types of operators
## Mathematical operators

  <li> +  : Addition</li>
  <li> /  : Division</li>
  <li> -   : Substraction</li>
  <li> *  : Multiplication</li>
  <li> %  : Remainder</li>
  
  ## Comparison Operator
  
  <li>< lesser than</li>
    <li>> greater than</li>
      <li>= Equal</li>
        <li><= lesser than or equal to</li>
          <li>>= greater than or equal to</li>
  <li>!= not equal</li>
  
  ## Logical operator
You should know this is a computer student. These are things like AND OR NOT. Python also has statements like if, then etc.
The computer takes 1 as true and 0 as False. So keep this in mind when consulting truth tables

## Indention
the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code and without it will spit out errors and refuse to run.
## Explaination
Like last time, if I was to remain here to explain each and everything, I would be here forever. Heres a screenshot, with the code and the result, side by side. The code is pretty self explainatory
